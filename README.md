Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.                                                                                                                                                                                         
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.                                                     
git lab, gitea, gogs                                                                                                                                                                            
The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command   only copies changes into your local Git repo.                                                                                                                                                                        
The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository.
